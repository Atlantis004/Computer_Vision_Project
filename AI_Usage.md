## Week 1: Feature Matching & Visualization

### 1. Image Display Boilerplate
Generated Python code to display a set of 10 images in a grid format.

### 2. Implementation of `cv2.drawMatches`
Consulted AI to verify the correct parameter parameters for `cv2.drawMatches` and to generate the code for displaying the final matched output because the `drawMatches` function requires specific input types (keypoints vs. raw points) and flag configurations. AI helped clarify these requirements to ensure the lines connecting matches were drawn correctly

## Week 2: Point Cloud Generation & Processing

### 1. Filtering Inliers with Masks
We used AI-suggested syntax for filtering point arrays using the mask generated by RANSAC:

    pts1_inliers = pts1[mask.ravel() == 1]
    pts2_inliers = pts2[mask.ravel() == 1]

Used `ravel()` to flatten the mask array into a 1D shape. And `== 1` because in OpenCV masks, a value of `1` indicates an "inlier" while `0` is an outlier so it allowed us to discard noise and keep only the valid geometric points

### 2. Color Extraction
Generated code to extract RGB color values from the source images corresponding to specific 2D keypoint coordinates so as to colorize 3D reconstruction

### 3. PLY File Saving & Visualization

1.  **PLY Format:** Generated the function to write the 3D points and colors into a `.ply` file format, including the correct header structure (`element vertex`, `property float x`, etc.) because the `.ply` file header requires a strict format to be readable by software like CloudCompare
2.  **Visualization:** Generated code snippets to visualize the resulting point cloud
